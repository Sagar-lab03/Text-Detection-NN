----- Training -----

1) first, we'll get the list of directories in our path (names of each folder)
2) To read and store images
3) Now, next we will convert it into numpy array
4) Splitting the data
5) finding IDs who have class = 0 (e.g.)
6) Making bar plot
7) Preprocessing
8) Add depth --> It's imp for CNN
9) Now we augment our images --> Means we'll add zoom, some rotation, will shift, add some translation
   This will make dataset more generic
10) One hot encoding
11) to run the training
12) Now, after the training process we want to know how was the loss of variation in the loss and accuracy
13) Save the model
